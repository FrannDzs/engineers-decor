As addon for Immersive Engineering, this mod is heavily inspired
by the designs and the code base of IE, and I would like to give
special credits to the Software Engineers of Immersive Engineering
(BluSunrize, malte0811, et al). Please see:

  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/
  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/graphs/contributors

Mod components derived/inspired by IE:

  - Style color scheme of treated wood/steel/concrete to match IE color scheme.
  - Recipe _constants.json file (for using IE items as ingredients)

IE components referenced in this mod:

  - immersiveengineering:textures/block/stone_decoration_concrete.png (for IE
    concrete wall).
